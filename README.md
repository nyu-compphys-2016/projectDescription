# Computational Physics 
## Project Ideas 

Your project should be challenging and physics based. The challenge may be one or a combination of:

1. *Physical* - Simulate/examine a complicated physical system (e.g. Relativistic or Magneto hydrodynamics). 
2. *Numerical* - You use a sophisticated numerical algorithm (e.g. tree/multigrid Poisson Solver, high order symplectic integrator, Richardson Extrapolation).
3. *Technical* - Implement your project in a technically sophisticated way (e.g. run in parallel, or on a GPU).
4. *Visualization* - Produce informative and attractive visualizations of your data (e.g. Animations, 3D, etc)

Your project does not need to be challenging in every way, but it should be challenging in at least one way. That is, you do not need to write a high-order relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code on a GPU, unless you really want to!

Your grade will be determined by a presentation in class on Dec. 13 or 15 (determined alphabetically by last name), and a report detailing the physics goals, methods, and results due Dec. 16, submitted on Github.

A one page proposal summarizing the system you want to study and the numerical techniques you will use, is due Nov. 15.

These are some sample ideas for your computational physics project. Feel free to use them, modify them, or do something completely different!  Please talk with Andrew or Geoff about your project ideas, to make sure they meet the goals above.

* **Planetary Systems**: Calculate the trajectories of a few (three or more) bodies with mutual gravitational attraction, varying the initial conditions. Possible goals: long-term stability, the onset of chaos, the Kozai-Lidov instability, orbital resonances.
* **Galactic/Cosmological Systems**: Calculate the evolution of many (>1000) objects under mutual gravitational attraction. Goals: measure the growth of large-scale structure, rotation curves in a galaxy.
* **Black Hole Formation**: Solve the Einstein Field Equations coupled to a simple form of matter (e.g. dust or a scalar field) in spherical symmetry. Goals: Examine gravitational collapse, formation of a singularity, growth of the event horizon.  How do these depend on the initial conditions of the matter?
* **Hydrodynamics**: Multidimensional hydrodynamics.  Possible goals are studying Kelvin-Helmholtz or Raleigh-Taylor instabilities, turbulence, jets, convection, or any other intersting phenomena.
* **Magneto-hydrodynamics**: 1 (or more!) dimensional magneto-hydrodynamics. Goals: Alfven/magnetosonic waves....
* **Relativistic Hydrodynamics**: 1 (or more!) dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics. Goals: Blandford-Mckee blastwave.
* **Moving-Mesh Hydrodynamics**: One Dimensional hydro on a moving (Lagrangian) mesh. Goals: Sedov-Taylor, Bondi Accretion.
* **Ising Model**: Monte-carlo to simulate coupled spins on a lattice.  Goals: Phase transitions, depenedence on dimension.
* **Statistical Physics/Molecular Dynamics**: Stochastic ODEs in biophysics or statistical physics.  Goals: Lambda phage behaviour, diffusion
* **ANY TOPIC OF YOUR CHOOSING**
