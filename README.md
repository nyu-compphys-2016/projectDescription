# Computational Physics 
## Project Ideas 

These are some sample ideas for your computational physics project. Feel free to use them, modify them, or do something completely different!

Your project should be challenging and physics based. The challenge may be:

1. *Physical* - Simulate/examine a complicated physical system (e.g. Relativistic or Magneto hydrodynamics). 
2. *Numerical* - You use a sophisticated numerical algorithm (e.g. tree/multigrid Poisson Solver, high order symplectic integrator, Richardson Extrapolation).
3. *Technical* - Implement your project in a technically sophisticated way (e.g. run in parallel, or on a GPU).

Your project does not need to be challenging in every way, but it should be challengin in at least one way. That is, you do not need to write a high-order relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code on a GPU, unless you really want to!

* **Planetary Systems**: Calculate the trajectories of a few (three or more) bodies with mutual gravitational attraction, varying the initial conditions. Possible goals: long-term stability, the onset of chaos, the Kozai-Lidov instability, orbital resonances.
* **Galactic/Cosmological Systems**: Calculate the evolution of many (>1000) objects under mutual gravitational attraction. Goals: measure the growth of large-scale structure, rotation curves in a galaxy.
* **Black Hole Formation**: Solve the Einstein Field Equations coupled to a simple form of matter (e.g. dust or a scalar field) in spherical symmetry. Goals: Examine gravitational collapse, formation of a singularity, growth of the event horizon.  How do these depend on the initial conditions of the matter?
* **Hydrodynamics**:
* **Magneto-hydrodynamics**:
* **Relativistic Hydrodynamics**:
* **Ising Model**:
* **Statistical Physics/Molecular Dynamics**:
* **Lambda Phage**: Replication of a virus
